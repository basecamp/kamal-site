# kamal proxy

Kamal uses [kamal-proxy](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal-proxy) to proxy requests to the application containers, allowing us to have zero-downtime deployments.

```bash
$ kamal proxy
Commands:
  kamal proxy boot                         # Boot proxy on servers
  kamal proxy boot_config <set|get|reset>  # Manage kamal-proxy boot configuration
  kamal proxy details                      # Show details about proxy container from servers
  kamal proxy help [COMMAND]               # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
  kamal proxy logs                         # Show log lines from proxy on servers
  kamal proxy reboot                       # Reboot proxy on servers (stop container, remove container, start new container)
  kamal proxy remove                       # Remove proxy container and image from servers
  kamal proxy restart                      # Restart existing proxy container on servers
  kamal proxy start                        # Start existing proxy container on servers
  kamal proxy stop                         # Stop existing proxy container on servers
```

When you want to upgrade kamal-proxy, you can call `kamal proxy reboot`. This is going to cause a small outage on each server and will prompt for confirmation.

You can use a rolling reboot with `kamal proxy reboot --rolling` to avoid restarting on all servers simultaneously.

You can also use [pre-proxy-reboot](../../hooks/pre-proxy-reboot) and [post-proxy-reboot](../../hooks/post-proxy-reboot) hooks to remove and add the servers to upstream load balancers as you reboot them.

## Boot configuration

You can manage boot configuration for kamal-proxy with `kamal proxy boot_config`.

```bash
$ kamal proxy boot_config
Commands:
  kamal proxy boot_config set [OPTIONS]
  kamal proxy boot_config get
  kamal proxy boot_config reset

Options for 'set':
      [--publish], [--no-publish], [--skip-publish]   # Publish the proxy ports on the host
                                                      # Default: true
      [--http-port=N]                                 # HTTP port to publish on the host
                                                      # Default: 80
      [--https-port=N]                                # HTTPS port to publish on the host
                                                      # Default: 443
      [--log-max-size=LOG_MAX_SIZE]                   # Max size of proxy logs
                                                      # Default: 10m
      [--docker-options=option=value option2=value2]  # Docker options to pass to the proxy container
```

When set, the config will be stored on the server the proxy runs on.

If you are running more than one application on a single server, there is only one proxy, and the boot config is shared, so you'll need to manage it centrally.

The configuration will be loaded at boot time when calling `kamal proxy boot` or `kamal proxy reboot`.
