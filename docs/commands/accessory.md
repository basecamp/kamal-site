# kamal accessory

Accessories are long-lived services that your app depends on. They are not updated when you deploy.

They are not proxied, so rebooting will have a small period of downtime. You can map volumes from the host server into your container for persistence across reboots.

Run `kamal accessory` to view and manage your accessories.

```bash
$ kamal accessory
Commands:
  kamal accessory boot [NAME]           # Boot new accessory service on host (use NAME=all to boot all accessories)
  kamal accessory details [NAME]        # Show details about accessory on host (use NAME=all to show all accessories)
  kamal accessory exec [NAME] [CMD...]  # Execute a custom command on servers within the accessory container (use --help to show options)
  kamal accessory help [COMMAND]        # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
  kamal accessory logs [NAME]           # Show log lines from accessory on host (use --help to show options)
  kamal accessory reboot [NAME]         # Reboot existing accessory on host (stop container, remove container, start new container; use NAME=all to boot all accessories)
  kamal accessory remove [NAME]         # Remove accessory container, image and data directory from host (use NAME=all to remove all accessories)
  kamal accessory restart [NAME]        # Restart existing accessory container on host
  kamal accessory start [NAME]          # Start existing accessory container on host
  kamal accessory stop [NAME]           # Stop existing accessory container on host
  kamal accessory upgrade               # Upgrade accessories from Kamal 1.x to 2.0 (restart them in 'kamal' network)
```

To update an accessory, update the image in your config and run `kamal accessory reboot [NAME]`.

Example:

```bash
$ kamal accessory boot all
