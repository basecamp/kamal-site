# kamal deploy

Build and deploy your app to all servers. By default, it will build the currently checked out version of the app.

Kamal will use [kamal-proxy](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal-proxy) to seamlessly move requests from the old version of the app to the new one without downtime.

The deployment process is:

1. Log in to the Docker registry locally and on all servers.
2. Build the app image, push it to the registry, and pull it onto the servers.
3. Ensure kamal-proxy is running and accepting traffic on ports 80 and 443.
4. Start a new container with the version of the app that matches the current Git version hash.
5. Tell kamal-proxy to route traffic to the new container once it is responding with `200 OK` to `GET /up` on port 80.
6. Stop the old container running the previous version of the app.
7. Prune unused images and stopped containers to ensure servers don't fill up.
